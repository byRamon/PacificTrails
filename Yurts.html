            <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
            <dd>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
                the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls,
                a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.
            </dd>
            <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
            <dd>
                Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down
                quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping
                experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and
                cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
                located in the lodge.
            </dd>
            <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
            <dd>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to
                dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.
                It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of
                adventure!
